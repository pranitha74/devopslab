##Chapter 1:The First Commit
In the beginning, there was only an empty repository.
A lone developer wrote the very first file, marking the root commit.

##Chapter 2:The Branching Begins
The first branch was created, diverging from the main flow.
On this branch, the story unfolded with new ideas and changes, each safely isolted yet connected to the root.
